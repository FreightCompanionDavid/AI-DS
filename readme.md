This project is set up to utilize Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications. With Next.js, we can build highly performant and scalable applications that provide a better user experience.

### Key Features of Next.js in Our Project:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js pre-renders pages on the server, which means our application's initial page loads faster, improving SEO and user experience.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** We can pre-render pages at build time, which is excellent for pages that can be served the same to every visitor.
- **API Routes:** Next.js allows us to create API endpoints as part of our Next.js application. This enables us to build our API without needing a separate server.
- **File-based Routing:** Next.js uses the file system for routing by default. Pages are automatically routed based on their file names in the `pages` directory.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support:** Next.js comes with built-in support for CSS and Sass, allowing for easier styling.
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js provides an Image component that automatically optimizes images for faster load times.

### Getting Started
